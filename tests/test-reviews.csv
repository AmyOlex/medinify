after taking actos for about 6 weeks I developed severe muscle pain in my right arm moving up to my shoulder and down to my hand I stopped taking it ,4,1,4
"Was previously taking Lantus and Jardiance, switched to Actos. Blood sugar averaged 95 previously, now is 145 on 15 mg/ day. Not very effective after 3 weeks so going to a double dose",5,2,2
Still maintain glucose level,5,2,2

test,3,3,3
When taking 15mg Actos my A-1c was 6.9 in June 2015. My doctor took me off Actos. Six months later my A-1c was 8.6. The doctor gave me a new script for 15mg Actos. I consider the chances of getting cancer miniscule and the chances of uncontrolled diabetes killing me at 100%. It is a good medicine that works for me.,5,5,5
On Actos for 5 years 30mg am 15pm. Terrible leg cramping and pain last 2 years but Dr would not take me off !  I lost 80lbs and ended up in the hospital after having a blood sugar of 24 ! Now being tested for bladder and Liver CANCER ! This IMO is a bad drug !,4,1,2
"First, I was fine with it for about a year, it seemed to help for the first 6 months and started declining after that.  But what I noticed was i'd have stomach problems and diarrhea.  I couldn't hold any food in, as soon as I eat I had to use the bathroom.  I started getting pains around my bladder area, then I read articles that it gave people bladder cancer.  By then I've been taking it almost 2 years and couldn't figure out that the small actos pill was really messing up my health,  my hair started falling out and it actually got pretty thin when I read that article, and told the doctor i'm stopping taking it.  Next thing you know, my stomach started getting better, my hair stopped falling out in bunches and did grow back a little, I still have a lot of hair loss, but at least i'm not bald.  This small pill caused my whole system to be out of whack, so not really sure what it was doing to me.  But if you have any of these symptoms, stop, it's only going to lead to something bad.",5,1,2
"Was taking 45mg daily, within last 6 months cut that does in half w/o effect of gluocse levels.A1c has been around 7 consistantly.After taking Actos for around 10 years new endocrinologist suggests not using it further because of potential side effects (stated in these reviews) none of which I have experienced. Questions: What side effects expected stopping Actosl short term and long term? ",4,4,4
"I was on Actos for 5 years.  Unbelievably, my doc put me on it only 6 months after I had a heart attack, in spite of the warnings about cardiac side effects.  It did keep my A1C down below 7, taken with metformin and glimiperide.  But I have suffered severe, debilitating leg and muscle pain.  But I never made the connection to Actos; I thought it was related to neuropathy and problems with my spine.  In May of this year my A1C was creeping up above 7, so my doc told me to increase my Actos dose to 45 mg from 30.  Within a month I became short of breath and had crackling sounds in my lungs when I breathed.  I just thought I had bronchitis and waited it out.  I also had terrible swelling in my ankles and feet, and then I broke a toe, too.  In Sept I was to return to the doctor and the night before, I began to wonder if the Actos could be causing the swelling.  Sure enough...I read all the warnings, and realized that I was well on my way to congestive heart failure!!!  I stopped taking Actos that morning.  Much of the swelling has gone down.  And my legs stopped hurting!!!  This drug has made my life hell for 5 years.",3,1,1
"i have gained 50lb since starting actos 30 mg  and levemir  25 units and javunia 100 mg day  that is not good, retaining fluid, bad, ",5,2,5
"With Glimprideride (3mg) twice daily, ACTOs has kept my sugar under 100 much of the time in the AM before eating.  I have never had any known problems with ACTOS.  I also take 5 Metaformin 500 AM,N, PM.  Not sure if metaformin helps. In 1990 sugar was over 400.  Started ACTOs + Glimpridie after about 1995 and saw big improvement.  Never had any low sugar problems.  ",5,5,5
"I lovingly  cared for someone who was killed by this drug.  It is important that you take the time to read the reviews of those who suffered serious harm from Actos, and remember that many people have died too.  Do they make these drugs in China, or are they an oversight from the FDA?  Who today would feed their dogs the killing treats made in China?  Actos was rejected by Canada and the UK several years ago.  Why does the FDA pander to the big pharma...we are the ones to be protected!",1,1,1
I JUST STARTED IT A MONTH AGO TO TRY TO GET OFF OF INSULIN,3,3,3
water retention,5,3,4
I've ben on Actos 30mcg for a year now. Has kept my blood sugar average around 130 (down from 300-400)but I have gained 25 pounds in 6 months! Also have had some shortness of breath. Doctor is putting me on Januvia.  ,5,3,4
"Let me eat what ever I want for over 5 years BUT    after stopping ,lost almost 80 Lbs in a year and no more getting up 5 times a night to urinate ..I wish I knew   Personally I think its bad medicine :-( ",4,3,4
"DEATH...what could be worse?  I was a caregiver to, and have witnessed the death of my dear brother because of ACTOS.  Words fail to express my pain after two years.  Please DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG...Mikey would have wanted me to tell you this.  He was on ACTOS for a few years...than suddenly he died...he is gone forever.  I've told the FDA...but...this is more about you and saving your life if I can.",1,1,1
" Looking for the worst side effect?  Read the reviews...DO NOT PRESCRIBE OR TAKE THIS DRUG...Liability for DEATH can be the future. (Not just bladder cancer.)  A quote from just one of many reviewers...  ""Even though my mother (75 yrs old) told her doctor she was experiencing side effects from the Actos (weight gain, swollen ankles, feeling like she was experiencing angina), he assured her that he was ""a good doctor"" and she needed to ""trust him"" and continue the medication in conjunction with Insulin and other diabetic and high blood pressure medication she was already taking. Even though he had told her that her heart was fine, she had a heart attack within a week of taking the drug and died. He should have paid more attention to her. A week after she died, we received a brochure in the mail warning of conjunctive heart failure as a side effect of Actos. Yes, I'm bitter. PLEASE reconsider before taking this drug!!!""    PLEASE EDUCATE YOURSELF...DEATH WITH THIS DRUG IS POSSIBLE.  LET'S TAKE THIS OFF THE MARKET...IT KILLS.",1,1,1
I don't care what the  FDA said when they put this drug back on the market... I have spoken to many oncologists in major hospitals and they have no doubt that 4 years of Actos caused my bladder cancer.  Shame on the FDA for giving in to pressure once  again.,5,1,3
water retention,5,1,3
my doctor started me on this medication as of 2/19/2014.,1,5,5
"My family member took ACTOS for pre-diabetic treatment...I was his caregiver before he died from taking this drug.  The negative reviews are a ""must read"" before using this sinister poison, and please report any bad experience with FDA. God bless us all.  ",1,1,1
"sore throat, blurred vision, pink urine, tiredness, very sore, muscles,and having problems not getting to the bathroom in time. urine in pants. Actos is not for me. Way to meaning side effects for me. ",4,1,2

"I was on actos for about 6 months and experienced unexplained fatigue, weight gain, fluid retention, shortness of breath and (the last straw that broke the camel's back) Congestive Heart Failure-CHF in Dec '13. Then when I reported  the CHF to my Endocrinologist on Jan 9 she said it was the actos and immediately took me off (the actos). I'm humbly advising all and sundry to stay away from this drug for it will damage you slowly. Now on a different med for trial",3,1,1
"I have been on 45mg of Actos a day for some time now, from the beginning I was so tired I slept 18 ours a day. I had no energy. I felt my life was over. Then I got the swelling. My face, feet, ankles but especially my thighs swelled to the point my wife said I looked like I had elephantitis. I gained over 100 lbs, 40 lbs in 6 months. This is a very bad drug. It already has a black lable but needs to be removed om the market. I had a heart attack about one year after taking this drug, I have serious thoughts if it caused it from all the swelling in my body. I had mention the swelling problem to my family physician many times and he just seemed to think I was over eating. I hardly eat anything. I finally asked my cardioligist, he immediately said it was the Actos. I have stopped taking Actos for 4 days now, I cant say at this point I feel better or less tired but my blood sugars are low 60 to 70 without the Actos. Don't Risk it people. Dont take this drug. I am very concerned as a diabetic with problematic blood circulation how this extreme swelling has further damaged organs, arteries, viens, or heart.",3,1,3
I USE TO TAKE METFORMIN AND IS NOT WORKING,1,1,1
"DO NOT USE ACTOS OR ANY OTHER PIOGLITAZONE DRUG My brother had all of the symptoms that many have posted here, and also developed pancreatic and liver cancer and died. He had also used Metformin at times. His decline happened quickly, and he died Oct.22, 2012. It is interesting to note that some of the reviewer experience was around the same time period during my brother's sudden illness.  Could it have been because of a bad batch of this awful drug, or the drug itself? Nothing can ease my pain, but to warn and protect you from harm is important to me. PLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR LOVED ONES USE THIS He was working Sept 3, and died October 22. He never had a sick day before this time. I sent my information to the FDA.   But you need to know this now.",1,1,1
"I took actos 30mg for 13 years. I could eat like any normal person. A 1C always good. Bladder cancer is a ""possibility"" but loss  eye site, kidney failure, and amputation  with high blood sugar are for sure. Stopped working now, but I an satified.",5,5,5
I have read and heard so many negative things including pancreatic cancer linked to act is that taking it is frightening.,2,1,3
"my type 2 diabetes has remained relatively unchanged since I began taking Actos about 3 years ago. But I have congestive heart failure, so I am concerned.",5,3,3

Blood sugars do not appear to be decreasing after almost two weeks of taking this medication,4,1,3
Used for 10 years.  Quit testing after 2 years as results never varied over 10 points. Stayed 110 -120. Heartbroken when it finally quit working.,5,5,5
"I have been on Actos for only two months and the results are satisfactory.  However, I just heard that use of Actos for 1 year or more can cause bladder cancer.  Is it worth it?",3,1,3
Quickly lowered my glucose levels. Experienced slight weight gain of 3-5 pounds.,5,4,5
"Taking Actos for 10 years, and 6 months ago, I began having symptoms of a heart attack. After $40,000 in hospital costs, the cardiologist reported my problems to be non-heart related. Then a family doctor took me off of Actos, and all those symptoms disappeared.",2,1,2
"Actos seems to work for me; however, I am experiencing arm and leg muscle pain. Has this been an issue with anyone else?  Have not had swelling or weight gain.  I previously was taking Actos in combination with Metformin, but am only taking Actos now. My A1C number is 5.1.",5,3,4

"**DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG** Your better off having high blood sugar than the crazy side effects and mental anguish you will suffer. Extreme fluid retention, no energy, short of breath, excessive weight gain. And when I say shortness of breath, I mean I sounded like darth vador and couldnt walk 20 feet without wanting to sit down. Friends were calling my family members asking what happened to me because it was changing my appearance. This drug is banned in other countries, why is it still allowed here?? I am furious over this... stole a year from my life!",4,1,4
"My dad was put on Actos a year ago and he has gone down hill ever since with very strange side effects. His face and neck is swollen to the point that it looks like he was wearing a ""fat suit"" on a movie set. (He didnt gain weight in his legs and arms like other people stated) His total weight gain so far is 35 lbs. But the biggest problem was he coughed ALL the time. He kept getting misdiagnosed with either pnuemonia or congestive heart failure. He had so much fluid in his lungs that he was getting it drained every 2 weeks. They had to insert a needle through his back to remove the fluid, if not he felt like he was drowning and having a heart attack. He would get short of breath just walking to the restroom at home. The first time they removed fluid from his lung they collected 30oz, 2 weeks later they pulled 50oz! One day he happened to get a phone call from an old friend who said stop Actos immediately because the same thing happened to him. We have wasted so much time,worry, and money thinking he had something horrible wrong with him. He's had EKG's, echo cardiograms,blood test, cancer scans, etc. All along it has been this drug. My entire family is outraged over this. Do not take this drug!! Although we trust his primary Dr., he didnt seem to know any of the side effects with Actos. Get the word out!",1,1,1

I'm not asking, I'm quitting.  I've been taking it for approx. (2) years, too long! Yes,taking 1 pill a day is easy and my A1C is always below 6.5 however, I wasn't an additional 100 pounds overweight either.

Libido suffered, started gaining weight despite eating a very strict zero sugar and zero carb diet and a vigorous exercise regime.  3 weeks after coming off the drug, libido is back, weight is dropping and sugar levels are much easier to control.

I looked it up on the web and it clearly stated under ""side effects"" that it CAUSES CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE!!  DON'T EVER TAKE THIS DRUG.  IT WILL KILL YOU.  After going off the medication I lost most of the weight I had gained, the swellling and shortness of breath went away and I could walk more that 20 feet without stopping to catch my breath.

Now, my muscles, knees, hands, shoulders, and legs hurt so bad I can't play any more, I can't do the farm & ranch work I've always done, and trying to sleep with the pain is nearly impossible. I got off of Actos for 2 weeks recently, but only saw mild relief....maybe I need to get off for a longer period of time. My diet hasn't been bad, but it's nearly impossible to lose weight. I have to take lots of Ibuprofen to tolerate the pain, and sometimes Vicoden at night.

I within 1 month had gained 20 lbs, and this was after I started eating less carbs and eating more fresh, uncooked vegi's. I now, Oct 2011 have been Dx's with new changes in my EKG.  I should never have been put on this medication, I have had abnormal Liver panels for more than 5 years. Not life threatening high just slightly elevated, and have been monitored closely since that time with no changes.
