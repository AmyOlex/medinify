after taking actos for about 6 weeks I developed severe muscle pain in my right arm moving up to my shoulder and down to my hand I stopped taking it ,4,1,4
"Was previously taking Lantus and Jardiance, switched to Actos. Blood sugar averaged 95 previously, now is 145 on 15 mg/ day. Not very effective after 3 weeks so going to a double dose",5,2,2

test,3,3,3
When taking 15mg Actos my A-1c was 6.9 in June 2015. My doctor took me off Actos. Six months later my A-1c was 8.6. The doctor gave me a new script for 15mg Actos. I consider the chances of getting cancer miniscule and the chances of uncontrolled diabetes killing me at 100%. It is a good medicine that works for me.,5,5,5
On Actos for 5 years 30mg am 15pm. Terrible leg cramping and pain last 2 years but Dr would not take me off !  I lost 80lbs and ended up in the hospital after having a blood sugar of 24 ! Now being tested for bladder and Liver CANCER ! This IMO is a bad drug !,4,1,2
"First, I was fine with it for about a year, it seemed to help for the first 6 months and started declining after that.  But what I noticed was i'd have stomach problems and diarrhea.  I couldn't hold any food in, as soon as I eat I had to use the bathroom.  I started getting pains around my bladder area, then I read articles that it gave people bladder cancer.  By then I've been taking it almost 2 years and couldn't figure out that the small actos pill was really messing up my health,  my hair started falling out and it actually got pretty thin when I read that article, and told the doctor i'm stopping taking it.  Next thing you know, my stomach started getting better, my hair stopped falling out in bunches and did grow back a little, I still have a lot of hair loss, but at least i'm not bald.  This small pill caused my whole system to be out of whack, so not really sure what it was doing to me.  But if you have any of these symptoms, stop, it's only going to lead to something bad.",5,1,2
"Was taking 45mg daily, within last 6 months cut that does in half w/o effect of gluocse levels.A1c has been around 7 consistantly.After taking Actos for around 10 years new endocrinologist suggests not using it further because of potential side effects (stated in these reviews) none of which I have experienced. Questions: What side effects expected stopping Actosl short term and long term? ",4,4,4
"I was on Actos for 5 years.  Unbelievably, my doc put me on it only 6 months after I had a heart attack, in spite of the warnings about cardiac side effects.  It did keep my A1C down below 7, taken with metformin and glimiperide.  But I have suffered severe, debilitating leg and muscle pain.  But I never made the connection to Actos; I thought it was related to neuropathy and problems with my spine.  In May of this year my A1C was creeping up above 7, so my doc told me to increase my Actos dose to 45 mg from 30.  Within a month I became short of breath and had crackling sounds in my lungs when I breathed.  I just thought I had bronchitis and waited it out.  I also had terrible swelling in my ankles and feet, and then I broke a toe, too.  In Sept I was to return to the doctor and the night before, I began to wonder if the Actos could be causing the swelling.  Sure enough...I read all the warnings, and realized that I was well on my way to congestive heart failure!!!  I stopped taking Actos that morning.  Much of the swelling has gone down.  And my legs stopped hurting!!!  This drug has made my life hell for 5 years.",3,1,1
"i have gained 50lb since starting actos 30 mg  and levemir  25 units and javunia 100 mg day  that is not good, retaining fluid, bad, ",5,2,5
"With Glimprideride (3mg) twice daily, ACTOs has kept my sugar under 100 much of the time in the AM before eating.  I have never had any known problems with ACTOS.  I also take 5 Metaformin 500 AM,N, PM.  Not sure if metaformin helps. In 1990 sugar was over 400.  Started ACTOs + Glimpridie after about 1995 and saw big improvement.  Never had any low sugar problems.  ",5,5,5
"I lovingly  cared for someone who was killed by this drug.  It is important that you take the time to read the reviews of those who suffered serious harm from Actos, and remember that many people have died too.  Do they make these drugs in China, or are they an oversight from the FDA?  Who today would feed their dogs the killing treats made in China?  Actos was rejected by Canada and the UK several years ago.  Why does the FDA pander to the big pharma...we are the ones to be protected!",1,1,1
I JUST STARTED IT A MONTH AGO TO TRY TO GET OFF OF INSULIN,3,3,3
water retention,5,3,4
I've ben on Actos 30mcg for a year now. Has kept my blood sugar average around 130 (down from 300-400)but I have gained 25 pounds in 6 months! Also have had some shortness of breath. Doctor is putting me on Januvia.  ,5,3,4
"Let me eat what ever I want for over 5 years BUT    after stopping ,lost almost 80 Lbs in a year and no more getting up 5 times a night to urinate ..I wish I knew   Personally I think its bad medicine :-( ",4,3,4
"DEATH...what could be worse?  I was a caregiver to, and have witnessed the death of my dear brother because of ACTOS.  Words fail to express my pain after two years.  Please DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG...Mikey would have wanted me to tell you this.  He was on ACTOS for a few years...than suddenly he died...he is gone forever.  I've told the FDA...but...this is more about you and saving your life if I can.",1,1,1
" Looking for the worst side effect?  Read the reviews...DO NOT PRESCRIBE OR TAKE THIS DRUG...Liability for DEATH can be the future. (Not just bladder cancer.)  A quote from just one of many reviewers...  ""Even though my mother (75 yrs old) told her doctor she was experiencing side effects from the Actos (weight gain, swollen ankles, feeling like she was experiencing angina), he assured her that he was ""a good doctor"" and she needed to ""trust him"" and continue the medication in conjunction with Insulin and other diabetic and high blood pressure medication she was already taking. Even though he had told her that her heart was fine, she had a heart attack within a week of taking the drug and died. He should have paid more attention to her. A week after she died, we received a brochure in the mail warning of conjunctive heart failure as a side effect of Actos. Yes, I'm bitter. PLEASE reconsider before taking this drug!!!""    PLEASE EDUCATE YOURSELF...DEATH WITH THIS DRUG IS POSSIBLE.  LET'S TAKE THIS OFF THE MARKET...IT KILLS.",1,1,1
I don't care what the  FDA said when they put this drug back on the market... I have spoken to many oncologists in major hospitals and they have no doubt that 4 years of Actos caused my bladder cancer.  Shame on the FDA for giving in to pressure once  again.,5,1,3
water retention,5,1,3
my doctor started me on this medication as of 2/19/2014.,1,5,5
"My family member took ACTOS for pre-diabetic treatment...I was his caregiver before he died from taking this drug.  The negative reviews are a ""must read"" before using this sinister poison, and please report any bad experience with FDA. God bless us all.  ",1,1,1
"sore throat, blurred vision, pink urine, tiredness, very sore, muscles,and having problems not getting to the bathroom in time. urine in pants. Actos is not for me. Way to meaning side effects for me. ",4,1,2

"I was on actos for about 6 months and experienced unexplained fatigue, weight gain, fluid retention, shortness of breath and (the last straw that broke the camel's back) Congestive Heart Failure-CHF in Dec '13. Then when I reported  the CHF to my Endocrinologist on Jan 9 she said it was the actos and immediately took me off (the actos). I'm humbly advising all and sundry to stay away from this drug for it will damage you slowly. Now on a different med for trial",3,1,1
"I have been on 45mg of Actos a day for some time now, from the beginning I was so tired I slept 18 ours a day. I had no energy. I felt my life was over. Then I got the swelling. My face, feet, ankles but especially my thighs swelled to the point my wife said I looked like I had elephantitis. I gained over 100 lbs, 40 lbs in 6 months. This is a very bad drug. It already has a black lable but needs to be removed om the market. I had a heart attack about one year after taking this drug, I have serious thoughts if it caused it from all the swelling in my body. I had mention the swelling problem to my family physician many times and he just seemed to think I was over eating. I hardly eat anything. I finally asked my cardioligist, he immediately said it was the Actos. I have stopped taking Actos for 4 days now, I cant say at this point I feel better or less tired but my blood sugars are low 60 to 70 without the Actos. Don't Risk it people. Dont take this drug. I am very concerned as a diabetic with problematic blood circulation how this extreme swelling has further damaged organs, arteries, viens, or heart.",3,1,3
I USE TO TAKE METFORMIN AND IS NOT WORKING,1,1,1
"DO NOT USE ACTOS OR ANY OTHER PIOGLITAZONE DRUG My brother had all of the symptoms that many have posted here, and also developed pancreatic and liver cancer and died. He had also used Metformin at times. His decline happened quickly, and he died Oct.22, 2012. It is interesting to note that some of the reviewer experience was around the same time period during my brother's sudden illness.  Could it have been because of a bad batch of this awful drug, or the drug itself? Nothing can ease my pain, but to warn and protect you from harm is important to me. PLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR LOVED ONES USE THIS He was working Sept 3, and died October 22. He never had a sick day before this time. I sent my information to the FDA.   But you need to know this now.",1,1,1
"I took actos 30mg for 13 years. I could eat like any normal person. A 1C always good. Bladder cancer is a ""possibility"" but loss  eye site, kidney failure, and amputation  with high blood sugar are for sure. Stopped working now, but I an satified.",5,5,5
I have read and heard so many negative things including pancreatic cancer linked to act is that taking it is frightening.,2,1,3
"my type 2 diabetes has remained relatively unchanged since I began taking Actos about 3 years ago. But I have congestive heart failure, so I am concerned.",5,3,3

Blood sugars do not appear to be decreasing after almost two weeks of taking this medication,4,1,3
Used for 10 years.  Quit testing after 2 years as results never varied over 10 points. Stayed 110 -120. Heartbroken when it finally quit working.,5,5,5
"I have been on Actos for only two months and the results are satisfactory.  However, I just heard that use of Actos for 1 year or more can cause bladder cancer.  Is it worth it?",3,1,3
Quickly lowered my glucose levels. Experienced slight weight gain of 3-5 pounds.,5,4,5
"Taking Actos for 10 years, and 6 months ago, I began having symptoms of a heart attack. After $40,000 in hospital costs, the cardiologist reported my problems to be non-heart related. Then a family doctor took me off of Actos, and all those symptoms disappeared.",2,1,2
"Actos seems to work for me; however, I am experiencing arm and leg muscle pain. Has this been an issue with anyone else?  Have not had swelling or weight gain.  I previously was taking Actos in combination with Metformin, but am only taking Actos now. My A1C number is 5.1.",5,3,4

"**DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG** Your better off having high blood sugar than the crazy side effects and mental anguish you will suffer. Extreme fluid retention, no energy, short of breath, excessive weight gain. And when I say shortness of breath, I mean I sounded like darth vador and couldnt walk 20 feet without wanting to sit down. Friends were calling my family members asking what happened to me because it was changing my appearance. This drug is banned in other countries, why is it still allowed here?? I am furious over this... stole a year from my life!",4,1,4
"My dad was put on Actos a year ago and he has gone down hill ever since with very strange side effects. His face and neck is swollen to the point that it looks like he was wearing a ""fat suit"" on a movie set. (He didnt gain weight in his legs and arms like other people stated) His total weight gain so far is 35 lbs. But the biggest problem was he coughed ALL the time. He kept getting misdiagnosed with either pnuemonia or congestive heart failure. He had so much fluid in his lungs that he was getting it drained every 2 weeks. They had to insert a needle through his back to remove the fluid, if not he felt like he was drowning and having a heart attack. He would get short of breath just walking to the restroom at home. The first time they removed fluid from his lung they collected 30oz, 2 weeks later they pulled 50oz! One day he happened to get a phone call from an old friend who said stop Actos immediately because the same thing happened to him. We have wasted so much time,worry, and money thinking he had something horrible wrong with him. He's had EKG's, echo cardiograms,blood test, cancer scans, etc. All along it has been this drug. My entire family is outraged over this. Do not take this drug!! Although we trust his primary Dr., he didnt seem to know any of the side effects with Actos. Get the word out!",1,1,1

TIRED ALL THE TIME, HUGE WEIGHT GAIN and MY LEGS ARE LIKE MEMORY FOAM FROM THE SWELLING, I know it is from ACTOS 30mg 1 per day (enough said).  TOO DANGEROUS!  I ALSO PEE ALL THE TIME, RIDICULOUS! I'm not asking, I'm quitting.  I've been taking it for approx. (2) years, too long! Yes,taking 1 pill a day is easy and my A1C is always below 6.5 however, I wasn't an additional 100 pounds overweight either.

"About 6 months after starting on this drug my sugar numbers started rising, MD increased dose to max for me but numbers kept rising. Libido suffered, started gaining weight despite eating a very strict zero sugar and zero carb diet and a vigorous exercise regime.  3 weeks after coming off the drug, libido is back, weight is dropping and sugar levels are much easier to control.

"I took this drug for approximately 2 months and almost immediately started having shortness of breath, swelling all over my bodym significant weight gain and symptoms of congestive heart failure.  I looked it up on the web and it clearly stated under ""side effects"" that it CAUSES CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE!!  DON'T EVER TAKE THIS DRUG.  IT WILL KILL YOU.  After going off the medication I lost most of the weight I had gained, the swellling and shortness of breath went away and I could walk more that 20 feet without stopping to catch my breath.  I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS DRUG TO ANYONE.",1,1,3

And for every pound I loss I gained 2 back I could not keep my weight down found out Actos keeps an average 10lbs on while your on it. Now I take it every two days as it helps keep blood sugars low.

Now, my muscles, knees, hands, shoulders, and legs hurt so bad I can't play any more, I can't do the farm & ranch work I've always done, and trying to sleep with the pain is nearly impossible. I got off of Actos for 2 weeks recently, but only saw mild relief....maybe I need to get off for a longer period of time. My diet hasn't been bad, but it's nearly impossible to lose weight. I have to take lots of Ibuprofen to tolerate the pain, and sometimes Vicoden at night.

I have been on actos for 7 yrs.I have had no side affects nor have I gained weight.I is doing a good job at controling my blood/sugar readings.But i am conserned about the resent findings that it may cause bladder cancer.,5,5,5
"I was placed on Actos shortly after being Dx with DM2 in March 2011. In July 2011 I switched Medical Clinics and the first thing that my new provider did was take me off of Actos and place me on an insulin pen. I within 1 month had gained 20 lbs, and this was after I started eating less carbs and eating more fresh, uncooked vegi's. I now, Oct 2011 have been Dx's with new changes in my EKG.  I should never have been put on this medication, I have had abnormal Liver panels for more than 5 years. Not life threatening high just slightly elevated, and have been monitored closely since that time with no changes. I need to talk to the Dr. about that and the fact that my Gall Bladder has been acting up since just after I started taking Actos. ",5,1,3
"I have been on Actos for about 3 years.  I have not seen any side effects.  To date I have lost 60 lbs.  My doctor took me off insulin, Metformin and Glypizide.  My most recent A-1C was 6.1.  However, after hearing about it causing bladder cancer, I asked my doctor and she is currently researching as I am doing.  ",5,5,5

Also have kidney and high blood pressure. Whats a person to do when the doctor recommends and puts you on drugs they all have some kind of side effects I have found in  the last 5 years, ",3,2,4

"I've been on Actos for some time now and I'm not seeing any of the side effects.  I do sweat a lot, but perhaps that is just being outside in Florida!  I've not gained any excessive amount of weight over the 4 years I've been on it.  I've also not suffered from pain or swelling at all.    The effectiveness of this drug is amazing.  I could live without out it, but I'd have to be extremely careful with my diet.  My A1C is good, so I think that shows it is effect.  With that said, after hearing about the cancer issues, I will be discussing switching with my doctor at my next visit.  Last time I checked two years ago, I didn't see anything that was as effective that didn't have significant risk associated with it.",5,5,5

Actos is a dangerous drug.  I had heart surgery in Jan. and then had complications of water retention around lungs.  I had three thoracintis (remove excess water) procedures.  After the third time a friend of mine sent me an article explaining that actos caused water retention.  I showed family doc and surgeon the article.  Family doc took me off actos immediately.  Four weeks later my surgeon found no evidence of water around my lungs.  My blood glucose level stayed the same as well.,4,1,1
weight gain. water retention,4,3,3
using actos has vaused le edema,5,4,5
increased irritation,5,1,1
"Actos did control blood sugars, but does it have side effects. Water retension and achy joints.  dont use this unless there are no other choices.  I have been taken off the drug and in 3 weeks time i feel 15 years younger.  I have increased glipizide and makeing other adjustment with the doctor to come up with a better result.",4,2,4
i have recently heard this medication may cause bladder cancer .is this true?,3,1,3
"I've been on Actos/Met 15/500 @ 3 times a day for approx. 6-7 yrs..  I have gained 30-40 Lbs. even though whatching my diet and exercise..I recently changed Dr.s and the first thing he did was take me off of Actos..It kept my numbers down,but having a pacemaker,the extra weight is horrible..",3,1,3
what are the side effects? I heard they are very bad?,5,3,4
It has controlled my level of sugar very well.  Hopefully i will never have to take insulin.,5,5,5
DOCTR PRE.,3,3,3
"I would like to know why I have not heard about the chance of bladder cancer till now.I have taken this drug for fifteen years ,I pee all the time because of water gain. Since taking this drug I have gained 100 pounds. sounds like it works . yeah right",5,2,2
I have gained weight and shad a swelling of the joints in my fingers.,4,3,3
"Taking Actos 30mg&Januvia100mg for 3 months. Weight gain 20lbs,swelling/bloating & heart palpitations. Dr diagnosis is Nesidioblastosis not DM2. I am questioning now why treatment for DM2 with these meds. All is very frustrating. I think I will go back to the metformin. My alc changed from 6.5 to 6.1 while on the Actos but I feel the health warnings should be listened to.",4,1,3
i love this drug,5,5,5
just started taking this drug so really hasn't time to work effectively.,5,2,3
Just starting this medication. Does anyone have anything good to say about it? It seems all I read about it is causes weight gain.,1,1,1
"My husband has took this drug actos for four months, He has had several of the complications, I was wondering if anyone could tell me if there is a law suite against actos for this medicine? if so how can i go about calling? Any help will help thanks,",3,1,1
"Have been taking this medication for four months know. Since i have had severe chest pains, Abdominal pains, persistent vomiting and nausea, and Frequent urination. ",3,1,1
"i have been taken actos for several yrs now, 15 miligrams, i wonder if it is affecting my muscles, they say i have fibromyalgia, could it be from actos.",4,4,4
"I have been taking this med for 8 weeks, and I have noticed some weight gain. I started out weighting 196lbs and now I'am 203lbs. I just wonder will the weight slow down or will it continue to escalate? I'am very concerned about the weight gain. Sometimes I notice that my feet and hands are swollen; but when I go to bed and wake up the next morning they aren't swollen at all; but later that day they become swollen all over again. Does anyone else have these same symptoms?",5,4,4
"all of these are true until this time. I am showing signs of chf. edema, soa and weight gain.",5,5,5
"What I need to know if it will contribute to or prevent weight gain/loss. My sister's nutritionist took her off this medicine when she staarted her weight loss program telling her this medication can prevent weight loss. I need to know if anyone else has had this experience. I am trying to lose weight, I ahve cut my portions in half & am eating healthier & exercising, but I am not losing weight. I need to know if it is becasue of the Actos medication? ",5,5,5
my nutrionist (I have type 2 diabetes) said a recent study shows that is drug may cause bladder cancer and he was required to tell me about it.  I have a history of breast cancer and there may be an alternative medicine.  I opt to for go the actos and just continue to use the medformin 1000 mg twice a day.  I am going to have some blood test done and will determine if I use actos or something else.  I need reassurance that this is the right decision.  My endocrinologist and nutriencist agreed.  ,3,1,1
I have taken Actos for over 5 yrs and have gradually had over a 50 pound weight gain. I have also had shortness of breath and edema. After a recent trip to the Dr.'s office (seeing a Dr. other than my primary care Dr.) I was told the extreme swelling in my right leg was probably a side effect of the Actos. I imediatly stopped taking this medication and after 1 week have lost 10 pounds and can actually see both my ankles again. I will be seeing my primary care Dr. and cant wait to ask him why after me complaing and being sent for mri on my leg yrs ago because of the swelling he didnt know or consider the side effects of this medicine. ,1,1,1
"Actos controls my blood glucose level, however, I am bothered by swelling of the feet, ankles, legs, etc.  I also suffer from shortness of breath.  I am looking for another med to replace it.....I changed from avandia to this and had similar problems.",5,3,5
"on actos for over five years. sixty pound weight gain, no energy, tired all the time, muscle pain",4,1,2
took actos/ off insulin/ died of arhythmina,3,1,4
"Doing without this drug makes me feel better, knowing all the side effects this product has. It has to much baggage for me I will ask my physician for another product that will do the same or better.",3,2,3
"ACTOS HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING MY BLOOD SUGAR, BUT I DO NOT APPRECIATE THE 15 LBS. THAT I HAVE GAINED SINCE LAST FALL.  MY DOCTOR HAS REDUCED MY DOSAGE FROM 30 MG. TO 15 MG. ",5,4,5
Metformin worked far better for me than Actos. Actos was also 15 times more expensive while failing to control blood sugars as well,3,1,1
Caused bloating and rapid weight gain; swelling of legs and feet.,1,1,3
"Made me mean and agressive, felt tired, and gained weight. Dont take this drug!",3,1,1
the medication made my stomach upset,2,2,2
"I used ACTOS for about a little over a year. It kept my sugar down, but I gained around 80lbs and was so tired and felt so bad that I did not feel like doing anything much. My doctor and I had a talk that we agreed that I needed to be taken off the drug. I have been off of it for a few months now and I feel better and have lost 15lbs already.",1,1,2
Just started this medication.,3,1,1
Just started this medicine.,1,1,1
"Taking Actos 30mg once a day, with Metformin twice a day for 6 months now. Have tried to control my diet during this time, and have been about 20% more active. My weight has dropped a lot, almost 22 pounds in this time period, and sugar level ranges between 84 - 120. A1C dropped from 6 to 5.1. Doctor is reducing Actos to 15 mg daily from 30 mg given the progress, but not ready to drop it entirely. He cites studies showing multiple benefits but I am not comfortable taking so many pills !",5,4,4
Test qa-00 ,2,3,1
It does not seem to be lowering readings. I take 15mg along with Amoryl,1,1,1
Took this med for 2 years and felt horrible although it kept the numbers down.  Had all the side effects except for edema.  I finally figured out what was causing the problems and stopped taking it.  My doctor just about fainted but listened and agreed with my self-diagnosis since I had done my research.,5,1,4
"I have taken this drug for 11 years and it does control my A1C well. Although i admit to extreme tiredness for some time now. This can be found at northwest pharmacy in Canada very reseanable, $88.00 for 100 pills generic.",5,3,5
"Actos kept my numbers down, but unfortunately I had terrible swelling and fluid retention and had to get off of it because I developed congestive heart failure.  Now I am in atrial fib and going through every test in the world.  Doctor put me on Januvia and it does not work as well.  I wish others luck with it.  I guess it wasn't meant for me.",4,2,4
"It lowered my readings after taking it about 5 wks, sometimes far too low.  Far too many side effects though, weight gain, many sinus problems.  I really did not feel very well while taking it.  Could not recommend it.",5,1,3
I couldn't pinpoint why I was having heavy breathing and overall tiredness.  also intense overall pain and weight gain.  this is not a good medicine for me.,4,2,3
I had swelling of my extremities and beleive this accerbated the nerapathy in my feet. I kept talking to my doctor about the swelling and they just put me on a water pill. this drug i believe auses more problems than it cures. ,3,1,1
worked well for me.,4,4,4
"My internist prescribed this drug for my diabetes.  When I saw my cardiologist he expressed alarm because of the side effect of fluid retention causing congestive heart failure.  He allowed me to try it for a couple of months, but it really had no effect on the diabetes, did cause swelling in my extremeties, and worst of all caused repeated sinus infections (due to swelling of sinus membranes)  Actos was not a good drug for me.",5,1,1
"I as well had the swelling feet and shortness of breath, stopped taking right away, still trying to find a diabetes medication that worked as well as Avandia.",4,1,1
"everything that i have said above is true. except that the side effects of swelling of the hands/feet, tiredness, trouble breathing, and other systems occured. conjested heart filure to say the leased. does not justified the means.that is only in my instense. so my doctor changed my diabetic medication. and i am still doing fine. fbs range from 127-163 every day so i am well satisfied with the results.",5,5,5
"My husband was taken off Actos (30MG) by his cardiologist In March of 201. His insurance decided to take it off the formulary. There has been no change in his numbers except that he lost some weight.  The swelling in his ankles has gone down.  I can only say that I go with him to his Drs. appts, I take notes and ask questions. If your doctor(s) don't listen to you maybe it is time to find another doctor. They are your employe, you pay them directly or thru your insurance premiums. It is your body, your qulaity of life. fight for your rights as a patient.",4,2,2
"2 yrs of diabetes, first a1c was 13.8. Started with glimepiride/metformin..work well A1c 6.1 gained wieght, swithced to prandin/metformin worked OK A1cs 7-8 range lost wieght, but eventually even with a low carb diet/excersize the A1c over 8. Started Lantus/metformin..felt great, had no idea how bad I had felt...was even thinking of stopping omeperazol for acid reflux..then Dr. added Actos 15mg, at first I blamed everything on a sinus infection/acid relux..but the swollen/burning tongue/throat, trouble breathing at night, and now chest pain that is not the same as the acid relux pain has me stopping against Dr's orders to keep it up. Otherwise my next stop is an emergency room this can not safe. But only 4 days off and the effects are calming down...not sure if after almost 3 months the actos had any effect on the blood sugar. But with Lantus/metformin my glucose is in control....it is very hard for me not to obey my Dr., but there are so many other diabetes drugs, why use this one? Anyone else out there been through this?",4,1,1
"I've been on Actos for several years and have had excellent results.  My problem with weight gain was not Actos related, it was a thyroid problem.  Finally my new doctor found I needed 2 types of thyroid medication.  My A1C has been 5.7 and highest was 6.5 I'm thankful I have had no adverse reactions with Actos.",5,5,5
I have taken this drug for over 4 years. The doctor seemed to think that it has been working for me. Then my insurance company dropped me and I could no longer afford to take it. After two weeks my blood sugars are more stable. My muscles and joints aren't as sore. I don't feel as tired. I don't feel hungry all the time. After reading these reviews I'm glad I no longer am taking it. I guess God is watching out for me.,1,1,1
"After increasing dosage it seemed to be fine but then steady and rapid weight gain and severe edema in feet and ankles.  25 lbs. 5 months.  Stopped use, can't risk heart trouble.",4,1,4
might be a good medicine but the price per tablet has become 13 $  per looking for a more cheeeeper pill,4,4,4
"30mg once a day for about 8 months. At First it brought my #s down, later they where all over the place. What I thought to be diabetes complication turned out to be actos side effects. swelling,weight gain, urgent need to urinate, sweet craving, tired all the time, pain,pain,pain, and more pain all my muscles, my legs, the bones in my feet and ankles. I have been off the drug for less than the month and my sugars have improved and nearly all symptoms are gone or rapidly improving. I do believe this drug was killing me. I know for sure it made my quality of life suck while I was on it, I feel reborn since I stopped taking it.",4,1,2
"My experience with this drug has been difficult you see, it does manage my blood sugar to within acceptable range.  This is fine, but I have the most excruciating leg, knee, joint pain and extraordinary weight gain.  I've tried to continue this regimine, but Actos makes it impossible for me to walk my dog, fit my wardrobe, and exist with the pain I feel.  Two two month usage trials left me unable to continue.  Had I known that it was the Actos which contributed to my pain I would have never tried it again.",3,1,3
expensive and causes weight gain. Been taking Actos for over 1 year - bs in 130 range and A1C 6.3 - 6.5.  No GI side effects.,5,2,4
cost to much to take with insurance,5,5,5
Need information from people who gotten Actos from on line / mail order pharmacies. Satisfied? Primary care physician okk with it? Shipping problems?,4,3,2
"causes heavy breathing,stomach cramps, always tired",3,2,3
l find it works  but have noticed my muscles a bones are beginging to play me up,3,3,3
"When I have taken regularly it seems to have been effective. My doctor has increased the mg recently. I have, however, been hearing on TV some potentially dangerous side affects.",4,4,4
I started taking ActosPlus Met about 6 years ago.  I started gaining weight and have water retention.  I am trying to lose weight so that I will be able to get off the medication.  My A1C is on the borderline.  ,4,2,4
"I am a type 1 diabetic however, my doctor advised me that my pancreas still makes a small amount of insulin.  Today he prescribed Actos for me however, I brought up the fact that Avandia was taken off of the market for causing heart problems and Avandia and Actos are made by the same company (I think). He advised me this was unrelated. Well, I purchased the drug and then read the insert. The insert gave one of the side effects as edema (swelling) and stated this drug could case CHF. Now, why the hell would I want to take a drug that can cause CHF??? I then stated doing some research and read the reviews on this site and more than half of them say the same thing.  You all cant be wrong therefore, I have decided to scrap this drug, even though I just spent $55.00, and go continue my insulin and exercise. I recently lost 22 pounds and dropped my A1C from 8.2 to 7.0 without this drug. I hate losing money but CHF and weight gain...  no I will just use he insulin and talk to my doctor about another medication. If he doesn't want to change it oh well, I will just change to another physician. You are the one who suffers. Take charge of your life and if your doctor doesn't listen drop him/her. Listen to your body. It is not lying to you.  Thanks for to all of you who took time to review this drug.",5,1,1
good,5,5,5
none,2,2,3
Prescribed 30mg 1/da by Dr today. Found with insurance I'd pay $111.00 for 90 and every 90 days will move me $647.55 towards medicare's donut hole. Checked Universal drugstore com and the generic (pioglitazone) is less than $40 for 30 tablets and Actos 28 tabs is $62.50. Details inform pioglitazone should not be taken if you have certain heart or liver problems. I'll soon see my gastroentrologist for a liver dysfunction and will run it by him before giving it the Actos generic a try. ,1,1,1
stablized my a1c,5,5,5
"IN 3 days i gained 12 pounds,had severe swelling in legs and feet and had only took this med for 5 days.HAD I'd read these reviews i would have never taken it.I agree it should be taken off market.",4,1,1
It has given me blurred vision & made it harder to lose weight,4,1,4
I have started swelling in my feet and legs,2,1,1
I take 1 pill a day along with glimepiride and metformin. They seem to handle my diabetis just fine.,5,5,5
Started with this medication and gained 5 pounds in the first week.  Went off medication then tried again after a month with the same results.  It is very expensive at $651 for 90 supply and with the side effects it is not worht it.  I also had some leg pain but the weight gain was the biggest problem and concern since I had by pass surgery also before starting the actos ,2,1,1
"I am so glad I read these reviews! After only 4 weeks of taking Actos, I have leg swelling/pain and severe abdominal problems. As of today, I am no longer taking this drug and hope for improvements.  This drug is awful and should be taken off the market!",3,1,1
"It works to keep blood sugar down, but sometimes too well. Have too many low blood sugar episodes. Have gained weight & have trouble breathing right after little exertion.",4,2,3
"I am very slow at climbing stairs.  Also, I have pains in my muscles both arms and legs. I had swelling in the ankles previously. Started taking it again per Dr. THESE ARE FACTS NO OTHER WAY TO PUT IT.",1,1,1
"It change my life to be a depressed person , loss of appetite . I started this medication 3 weeks a go , I use to have Avandia .",2,1,2
"insulin does not work to well with me,takeing actos along with insulin works.it has taken 2 yrs to get my a1c down .only i have to watch not to let sugar drop to low and crash",5,5,5
This medication is to expensive.,3,2,2
Have discovered that I have been more severely depressed with a lot of crying spells since starting Actos.  Just curious if anyone else has had the same problem.  Have not found any evidence of this side effect in the provided information. ,4,2,2
"Had some blurred vision.  Being legally blind in one eye I am very wary of anything that bothers the other eye.  Also I broke my leg over three years ago and have not had any trouble until after I had been on Actos about three months.  Now I have terrible pain, worse than the broken bone.  I quit Actos a week ago and the pain is much better but has not gone away completely.  No weight gain but since I am trying to lose weight and having no luck I am hoping that it will change with the drug out of my life.",4,1,2
"Actos seems to control the Diabetes, however it has done nothing to help with weight gain. As careful as I am, the weight seems to creep up slowly.",5,5,5
For over 4 yrs. I have taken this drug. My A1C blood tests result in normal values.  I do not test my blood sugar because no doctor has ever told me I am a diabetic.  I do think a doctor said I was  pre-diabetic when I started this drug.  My last visit to the internist was 4/10 where the lab tests were normal.  I have told the doctor that I do not believe I have diabetes.  Maybe this last time I told him that he may have decided that was enough because he said he would see me in a year (4/11).  I do not have the s/s of diabetes except that I am overweight.  I try to watch my weight and take walks for exercise.,5,2,3
blurred vision,4,4,4
no diabetic complications.,5,5,5
Why is this medicine  so costly? Why do you all not have a generic to Actos?,3,3,4
actos is very exspinsive costing $200 plus dollars who can afford it it puts a horrible burdin low income elders with out enogh monnies and insurence,4,4,4
I have had a very good experience with the treatment of Actos for controling my blood sugar. The doctor said I either had to take this medication or use insulin again. I chose Actos.,5,5,5
I have gained over 50# while taking this medication.  I have told my doctor I need to come off this medication. ,5,1,2
"I am 54 years old and I was on Actos for about 8 months and gained 30 lbs, my eye sight and vision was blurred, my legs would ache so bad. I got off the drug and seem to be better, I did try it one more time and the same effects, this time I felt like I was having a heart attack...now going to see a cardio and I am off actos and will not go back on it again!!!! I do not have the bluured vision, leg aches, I have lost 10 lbs now to see what is up with my heart.  ",5,1,3
As soon as about 3 weeks my vision changed 1 diopter and  my legs are tired. I stopped it and within 4 weeks my vision returned to normal and I feel less fatigue. ,5,1,1
"1 pill a day, but i wish there was a generic, being retired the copay is $86.00 and along with other medications i can't afford it",5,5,5
this really help keep my blood sugar down,4,5,5
"I took Actos for a couple of years and it did help with my blood sugar levels.  But I had to stop when my ankles were swelling, and I felt so tired I could hardly walk.  Felt better soon after I stopped the Actos.  ",4,1,2
"i HAVE MANY OF THE LISTED SIDE EFFECTS, INCLUDING, EYE PROBLEMS, WATER RETENTION, WEIGHT GAIN AND MUSCLE ACHE.  i AM NOT SURE THIS IS THE CORRECT MEDICATION FOR ME.  I TAKE IT WITH AMARYL FOR MY TYPE2 DIABETIS.",3,2,3
I take Actos one time daily. My blood sugar levels have dramatically dropped since I started my treatment a month ago. I am very happy with the medication Actos.I  am not experiencing any side effects whatsoever.,5,5,5
I was given actos for a year. I didn't thoroughly check possible side effects.  It can distribute fat near the heart & belly.  I went to glipizide after talking with my doctor.,5,1,3
"Took it for nine months gained 28 pounds eating 1200 calories a day and going to the gym and walking.  FInally my feet started swelling.  My original doctor said to use compression stockings!  I changed doctors and found a diabetic specialist who took me off of actos.  I am on two other medications that control my diabetes.  I lost 10 pounds in the first six weeks off of actos.  This stuff is toxic.  It gave me memory problems, tiredness among others.  Within one week off of this stuff, I felt so much better.  This drug should be banned and doctors who prescribe it should be versed in its side effects!",2,1,1
this med has made me so tired i can hardly syat awake,2,2,3
"I am already over weight, a minimal weight gain for me is not acceptable.  There has to be something else for people like me.",5,1,1
I have noticed a weight gain of about 10 lbs in six weeks and swelling in my legs after six weeks,3,3,3
I have gained weight and want to know if it's because of this drug?,5,3,3
"I have been taking Actos for approx. 8 years. My blood sugar numbers are good, around 130. I don't have highs or lows, and my A1C is 6.1. I had been on other diabetes medicine before, and this one has been good for me.  I've had no side effects taking it these 8 years.",5,5,5
"I am 68 years old. The first day after I took actos, my blood sugar dropped to 89.  But in the following two weeks, my blood sugar readings were between 130 and 140 which are higher than before I took the medication.  Does anybody have similar experience? ",2,1,1
"I took this med several years back and had a problem with swelling in hands & feet. My doctor at that time took me off of it.  I have since changed doctors- I was put back on it 2 weeks ago. Within a week my blood sugar had come down from high 200's to 160. The medicine works, however, I woke up one morning and had the worst headache of my life, I felt like I was in a daze, I could hear my heart pounding in my head and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. I was short of breath without doing anything. I  quit taking the med, it took me three days to feel normal again. I contacted my doctor & told him what I experienced- he told me the medicine did not cause that. Well, if it didn't- what did? It went away when I stopped taking the med. I also reacted this same way when I was put on Avandia. I feel these meds are dangerous for me.",4,1,4
"I've been on Actos 15mg for 3 months.  My A1C went from 7.1 to 6.0 and my triglycerides dropped over 100 points down to 192.  I have gained 10lbs but have not had any breathing problems.  THere has been the achiness but nothing like some of the reviews I have read.  After talking with my doctor, she said that I really don't want to take you off as I am showing the best numbers I've ever had.  She said try to add some more excerise in and see if that helps with the weight gain.  I've never been this ""healthy"" since being diagnosed so if I have to deal with the extra weight, I'll fight that battle too.",5,4,5
"I'm 60 years old and have been on Actos for about 1 year (April 2009-July 2010).  My ankles had swollen a couple of times but now they are swollen constantly and are painful (last couple of days).  I now have joint pain in my shoulders and have gained about 40 pounds.  I'm done with this drug.  Quit taking it last night.  This cure is worse than the disease.  I'll watch my blood sugar tests, watch diet closely, exercise and see how I do.  If I still need something, I'll talk to my doctor about Januvia or something else.  Actos did lower my A1C, but the side effects are not worth it.  I would not recommend this drug to anyone.",4,1,3
"Just an update from my review two days ago.  I stopped taking the Actos about 2 1/2 days ago and I feel SOOO much better.  I am not having issues with my breathing, my muscles are not aching, my shoes don't feel as tight and I haven't been tired all day.  I know some people have had great results, but for me it wasn't worth it.  My A1C did go down a lot on the Actos, but my quality of life was terrible.  Actos may be getting more credit because I have changed my eating habits and also take Glipizide.    I feel like a new person the last two days.  I ran for 30 minutes today and didn't have to stop every 4 minutes because I felt like I was going to have a heart attack and couldn't catch my breath.  Now I just need to lose the 50 lbs I gained while I was on Actos for 19 months.  Funny how the Dr tells you that you need to lose weight to have a chance to get off all the meds, but yet they give you a pill that makes you gain weight.  I have also been checking my BG levels and they seem to be fine so far. If you are having any of the same problems I have had I would recommend you talk to your Dr.  Mine just blew me off and said I need to exercise and lose weight and I the ""problems"" I was telling him about would go away.  Funny not taking Actos for 2 and a half days and my ""problems"" seem to be going away.  I wish I could get my money back for the office visits, xrays, ct scan, blood tests, etc.  And it wasn't just my PA that didn't figure out the problem I saw the two ""big dog"" Drs and they both said lose weight and I probably had Chronic Fatigue.  I think it is only going to be a matter of time before the word gets out about what Actos really does to some of us.",1,1,3
"Yes, I believe this medication works. As all of us Diabetics know we have to keep are weight down. I gained 35 lbs in  15  weeks. I also have RA and I was thinking my extra fatigue and swollen feet was due to RA. I am going to see my doctor next week to get off this medication. ",3,1,3
I did gain 16 pounds and seem to be tired all the time. I know I'm always hungrey lately. It did bring down my number to 7.0 but I've been having some issues with my breathing. I will be seeing my doctor and ask her about these symptoms. I was on it once before and she took me off. I'll be working out in the gym again so I'll see how that goes.,3,2,3
"After reading other reviews I am terrified.  I have been on Actos for about 14 months.  I have gained 50 lbs and am constantly tired and have muscle aches/pains all day long. It lowered my A1C for sure (well maybe just changing my diet did, but my Dr has given the credit to Actos).  I have been convinced that I have something major causing these problems.  Had Xrays CT Scans, etc.  Nothing.  I have had sinus and lung congestion problems even hacking up blood from time to time.  Now I am starting to have shortness of breath.  I have had a few instances of waking up feeling like I was sufficating because I couldn't breath.  I couldn't even complete the basic functions of my job.  I have tried to work out but can't go very long and have had little to no results for weight loss.  I was a scholarship athlete in College and have always been in good or decent shape at worst.  I never had a problem putting the work in at the gym but can't do it now.  I am going to stop taking the drug and see what happens I have no doubt this is the cause for more problems than the little help of a lower A1C.  I am up to 270+lbs.  I would rather go off it and die than keep living this way. I can barely play softball or play with my nephews let alone have the energy to put into a girlfriend or work.  This drug is evil and I think it is only a matter of time before the cat is out of the bag on how bad these side effects are.  I have never liked the sue happy mentality of people now a days, but I am furious with my Dr and can't believe this drug is around you get paid a lot of money to make me feel better not worse.  Of course it isn't about patients it is about money.  I wish I would have known this a year ago.   Oh my Drs response to my description of my symptoms and telling him I feel like I am just surviving daily at this point was I probably have Chronic Fatigue and there is no way to test for that.  I wonder if he gets an all expenses paid vacation on the company that makes Actos? ",1,1,3
"i started taking Actos in November and by May i had gained almost 40 pounds and was retaining water in my feet and legs. My Doctor stopped my dosage and put me on diuretics, which i have been on since (it's now July). I have never had this problem before now. Actos truly screwed me up. ",4,1,4
I gained 75 LBS when on this medican so i stoped it,5,1,4
Actos has worked very well in assiting with maintaing my blood sugar. Also my diet and exercise are important contributors to keeping me in check. My A1C has been in a normal range as well as my daliy testing.,5,5,5
Some swelling of late when the dosage was increased from35 to 40 mg ones a day. Some fatigue and balance issues.,4,3,3
Blood sugar drop to within range within a week.,5,5,5
"i now have the symptons of conjestive heart failure, and yet my doc still wants me to take it, so he cut the dosage in half, and has not said anything about conjestive heart failure, but from reading the literature, i have all the symptons. I am very upset that my doc seems to be oblivious to my concerns.",3,1,4
I have had no problems with this drug. Been on it for 3 years  have gained about 50 lbs and have joint pain but until now didnt think it could be from this medication,5,5,5

"After one year on this drug I gained over 45lbs, my legs and knees were swollen with fluids to the point I needed a cane to walk. Then I had the heart attack.

"In 4 months I have 15 pounds even while trying to loose weight.  Swollen ankles and legs, fingers, hands.  After reading numerous reviews I now realize what I have to do.  I'm going to my doctor and telling him I must be taken off the medication.  I'm also tired all of the time.  I've had this happen with other meds and when I mention it to the doctor I'm told that the medication doesn't do these things but I'm not a stupid person.  I have to learn to trust myself and do what I think is right for me.",5,1,5
I have swelling of the legs and weight gain. i had a operation 51/2 years ago and lost 50 lbs. Since then I put that weight back on and more. I have been taking Actos 30mg for a number of years and my sugars were always good until recently. My ac1 reading was about 6.5-6.8 now the last time it was well over 7.2. I'm going to talk to my Dr. as soon as I can. This page was very helpful.,3,2,3
I don't seem to have any sde effects with this medication. I have to see when it is best to take this as I take metformin too,5,5,5
"The Actos did work for me when it came to controling blood sugar. I had issues with feet and ankles swelling and had a signifigant weight gain after starting the drug 2 years ago. After I stopped taking the drug, the swelling in my feet went away and I started dropping weight.",4,1,4

I have problems that I didn't know Actos was causing. Too many to mention.My new Dr expects Actos to be taken off the market soon. Its too soon to know if Metfonim is working. I will post results later.,4,2,3
"I've been on Actos for many years. A1C's are great. I've had swelling in legs, severe pain in hips and knees, chest pain that has ended up putting me in the hospital several times (diag. as angina), put quite a bit of weight on and unable to loose it. I thought all of this was do to other things in my life. I've recently been going to a diabetic education class. The lady teaching it has sent a request to my doctor to change me to metforin. I didnt know all of these things could be caused by Actos. Hope it all gets better.",4,2,4
"unable to lose weight. swollen feet, often.",3,3,3
Being diabetic I have had minimum problems for years after discovering the condition.  then I began having a problem with abdominal swelling and excess salivating.  Checked in with the primary doctor who was busy at the time and the nurse told me to purchase at drug store Prilosec and anti-gas which I did.  Did not help so I went to see another Doctor who called my primary care doctor (Secure Horizon Doctor) and they both told me to go to the emergency room.  Stayed in hospital for 5 days and they changed my medication and stopped my Actos.  Why?  They told me that my Kidneys were working only 35%.  What happened to me? Did Actos have anything to do with my kidney disfunction?,5,4,3
had very bad chest pains thought i was having heart failure. chest pains stoped within 3 days of stoping the drug will not try it again. it did lower blood sugars,4,1,4

I never guessed it was the medication until I rec'd a flier in the mail telling of the side affects.  I stopped taking the meds.  My A1C is fine & I've dropped a few pounds but I still have shortness of breath & knee aches.  ",4,2,4

"Good, but I worry that ACTOS, 30mg. is a black box warning drug. I also take Januvia, 100mg. also black box. Both daily in morning w/o food.",4,4,4
"I took Actos for about 5 years.  My blood sugar control was so good the Hg1ac tests were in the less than 7 range and the last one was 6.2.  I experienced none of the side effects listed, except fractures.  In the past 2 years I have broken an ankle, a knee and a hip.  Only after the knee was I aware that fractures were a possible side effect of Actos.  That was quite a blow to me, realizing that drug that was helping me so much was responsible for my, NOW, difficulties walking.",5,1,5
I have been on ACTOS for about 10 yrs and I do not think it is helping anymore. But my doctor will not change it for something that may better control my diabetes,2,1,3

The stomach bloating, fatigue, severe unexplained edema of the feet, legs, hands and face has totally stopped and I fee great.  My sugars did go up a bit but not enough for me to ever use this again!  I can't tolerate the weight gain, pain, fatigue and swelling.  Can't believe this is allowed to still be given to people and my doctors didn't seem to aware of the side effects which is disturbing or they didn't care.  Kept attributing my swelling to sodium, my pain to my statin drug and my weight gain to my eating.  My diet hasn't changed or my exercise level and since stopping this I have lost significant weight and all other symptoms disappeared.  I have lost faith in my doctors.  Do your own homework and keep speaking up - you know your own body and feelings.  This has negatively impacted the quality of my life.",5,1,3

I was taken off of Avandia. I am taking Actos (30mg) with Metformin (1000mg) once daily and my A1c remains at 6.0. No side effects. I take my pills in the morning. I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes in 2002.,5,5,5

"At age 70 Dr diagnosed me as ""pre-diabetic."" He prescribed actos 45 mg once daily. Almost immediately afterward my vision was severely affected and began experiencing terrible fatigue symptoms, especially in legs.  After nearly passing out with low blood sugar symptoms, which my wife recognized because her mother was diabetic, she took me home and fed me candy bar which restored my normal feeling almost immediately.  After reporting this to DR, he took me off any med for this condition.  For next year a1c has been 6.2 without any meds for diabetes.  My recomendation: watch out.  ",3,1,1
"I responded once before on this site regarding actos.  After 3 years of chest pains, weight gain, severe leg pain, stomach cramps, I finally gave up on all the oral medications and went on Insulin.  While it can be inconvenient to inject every day I feel better than I have since my diagnosis in 2003.",2,1,2
"Ok so i have been on actos since august i believe. since being on actos i have been completely unmotivated and depressed so my doctors answer was to put me on depression medications, none of which worked and had horrible withdraw symptoms. i have also gained at least 40 pounds and continue to gain and my blood sugar levels seem to not be affected. i also have noticed swelling in my hands and can not wear my ring from my grandma any longer, it doesnt fit on any finger. i have not noticed the swelling in my feet and ankles as much though. one problem that i do have is that i get horrible migraines and nausea along with lightheartedness and dizziness which put me in the hospital but the doctor on call that night did not seem to think it was a big deal and sent me home even though my blood sugar and blood pressure was high. i also have hair loss and sometimes my heart beats so fast and i can not even exercise anymore because i get so out of breath. i am considering going off this medication because i believe that it caused the depression and the migraines. i do not think this is a healthy medication. i tried metformin and that was also a horrible experience, i will give one more try with byetta and then i am switching doctors and going to try natural methods. has anyone else had any of these side effects or any advice?",5,1,2
"After the A1C test that includes holiday seasons, a 'nurse practitioner' who was 'acting DR'? pushed this pill on me (drug rep gave her boxes of samples) at first i became nervous and oddly agitated; i went back to see her - she told me 'that was a psych issue - go see a psych md' so i did; and she also passed the buck back to nurse prescribing it. so, i stayed on it and gained weight and stayed nervous and odd feeling for over six month; by the hot part of July in Kansas i found my feet swollen one night at bed time and was shocked by what i saw. was admitted to ER that night for edema four days and night of IV lasix i was able to go home. discontinued ACTOS! it was unsafe from the first pill! Also; now I have permanent edema- swelling in ankles; any time i try to get off another med I have been given; the edema kicks in and makes it hard to stop using that drug. After taking Lasix for several years- after that ER/hospital visit i stopped lasix and the swelling in my legs went down!! so lasix does not fix what ACTOS damaged!  I DO NOT recommend using this medication for any reason. it will damage your body. I was not monitored by a proper doctor, but that seems secondary to what the actual drug did to me. No DR is going to know or advise what those of us who have experienced it can tell you. reading the similarities in stories will convince you of probable outcomes, for most using it. those who do use it, and can't say much- may be too sick to know the difference. find another way to lower your blood sugar- and A1C tests that include Thanksgiving and Christmas and are taken after that period of time lead doctors to over react and give out this kind of big pharma junk. read up on these things; your own life depends on it.

"First, my doctor put me on Metformin which caused diareah and gas.  Then he switched me to Actos, which causes diareah and gas.  On both medicines, he prescribed dicyclomine for these symtoms.

I dont want to die from a drug! I did not take it today and I will never take it again..I am ready to go to a urgent care and be fully checked out.

He also suspened 100mg of januvia. Blood tests showed that my liver and kidney functions was out of wack. So he suspened the Metformin for a week. He prescribed Glucotrol XL 10mg X2 a day. I use to take this and with 500mg metformin and felt great. I dont recommend Actos since it causes massive weight gain. I also believe that Januvia had a hand in it as well.  Check this out: Daye before yesterday I took 1000 mg Metformin, 45 mg Actos and morning BS was 121. Last night I took 10mg Glucotrol XL and morning sugars was 150.

Even though he had told her that her heart was fine, she had a heart attack within a week of taking the drug and died. He should have paid more attention to her.

My A1C dropped to 7.0 which is great. I have been exercising 30-60 minutes(walking 60, bike 30-45) 3-4 times/week. No weight gain, no swelling/water retention, no muscle soreness to date.

"Weight gain, tired, tooth pain that sent me through the roof when having teeth cleaned.  Swelling more often than before.  Took for one year with fluctuating A1C tests from Under 7 to Over 8.  Now on glipizide with Metformin.  ",3,1,1
I take a 45 mg pill --- have from the very start. I also take 2000 mg of metformin per day as well. Both drugs used to control diabetes. No problems at all with the Actos. I was taking the metformin several years before adding the Actos. The Actos brought my numbers down about 20-25 points. No weight gain at all? Several posters mentioned this as a problem.  ,5,4,4
"Well I'm 52 & had a heart attack a few months ago. And I see where the side effects are severe, so I intend on talking to my Doctor about this. I also have alot of water retention and am on a water pill seperately and my retention doesn't go away, so this is something else to talk to my Doctor about. ",5,3,2

My husband is going to start taking this drug. He already has a high LDL level and a low HDL level and is currently on three meds for this. How is this going to effect his cholestrol?,1,1,1
"Actos is evil!  Beware.  Many Type II Diabetics have a weight problem.  Actos causes major weight gain and swelling.  I was on it for several years and gained a lot of weight.  I can attribute 40 plus pounds to Actos and no other reason.  I finally had lap band surgery and my doctor allowed me to stop taking Actos and only take Metformin.  I've lost over 80 pounds now.  The Actos was effective in lowering blood sugar, but the cost was too high.  My husband is a more severe diabetic than I am and also gained a large amount of weight on Actos.  He begged his doctor to take him off Actos.  In exchange he now has to take 2 more shots per day of another medication, in addition to his 6 insulin shots, but he has stopped gaining weight, so he's happier.",4,1,4
"leg pain, hard breathing, breaking out in  sweats, skin breaking down under breast, belly,arms, etc.  I never had any of these problems before.",1,1,1
"was on this medication for 6 weeks. had muscle pain in upper leg. the longer i was on it, the longer the pain lasted and tydenol didn't do anything for it. called dr and he said to stop taking it for 1 week. i did and no pain. it was awful. never had muscle pain like that. worse than a charley horse as it lasted 2 hrs or more. so glad i am off of it",4,1,1

my doctor added this to my glipicide to try and bring down my blood sugar.  So far it has not seemed to work.  It has been one month.  How long would this usually take to begin working?,3,1,1
"Blade, yes it is the reason.",5,1,4
I do not know of this medication is the cause....but in the past year i have gained 25 lbs...swelling feet....severe leg cramps at night and possible congestive heart failure....is this pill the reason??,3,2,2
"I began taking 15mg Actos in 12/08 in addition to 2000 mg of Metformin to eliminate the need for Glyburide.  I am now taking 45 mg Actos, 2000 mg Metformin and only 1.25 mg Glyburide (at night).  The transition was somewhat difficult, but it has worked.  I gained 11 lbs and have now lost 4.  My A1c went from 6.0 to 5.4.  I'm very pleased and will be even happier when I lose another 15 lbs.",5,5,5

I am having all of the side effects noted above from taking 1 pill of the Actos Oral.  The muscle spasms are terrible as well as vision problems.  I wish I could return the rest of the pills.  They are worthless to me & cost me $35.00 for a 30 day supply.,1,1,1
"Due to weight gain, shortness of breath and swelling in my ankles, I plan to talk to my dr. about stopping Actos and replacing it w/ another newer drug. ",5,1,2
"This medication has helped in controlling my blood sugar level (along with lantus).  However, I experienced a 12 lb. weight gain within the first 10 days of being on it.  I was following the Weight Watchers plan at this same time and had been losing weight. I also experience lots of swelling in my ankles which is very uncomfortable and not very attractive. I think I will ask my doctor if we can try decreasing the dosage or maybe try something different.",5,2,5
"When I started this drug I weighed 153 I am now up to 212. Have discussed with the Dr. numerous times. I have also developed a heart murmur. Have recently noticed increased Neuropathy upon lying down. Shortness of breath, just plain miserable.

Very good,5,5,5
"started w/30mg added to glimipiride.  was not working until i switched to taking it before bed. Then works great! I haven't mention to dr yet, but i think is was reacting w/some other meds.

yes,4,3,3
I have gained weight with this medication and just found out I have heart problems and was never told I should have not been on it.,5,3,3
I dont think I should be taking this. I have hep C and web MD says I should not be taking actos. I have stopped taking it and now will let my doctor know.,3,1,3
bilateral foot & ankle swelling; weight gain,5,1,4
I have been one week without the Actos and the foot sensation/sweating/numbness is totally gone. The dizziness is gone also.  I saw my doc yesturday and she refuses to beleive it could have been the Actos.  I am convinced on the other hand that it was.  One bad thing is my apptite has returned and I have gained 1/2 a pound back.  It was helping me to lose weight so I am gonna try a lower dose instead of 45 I'm gonna take half of that and see how I do.  I have a ecko for my heart scheduled soon to see if it has damaged my heart any.  I didn't have any swelling at all anywhere or weight gain but the feet dumbness and cramping was terrible if that starts back I'm through with this drug period.  Please be careful.  You know your body better than anyone.  I may even go to a even lower dosage like 15 and see what happens.  45 was just too much for me.  ,4,3,4
"Gained weight, feet & legs would swell so bad they hurt. Headaches and very tired all the time. A1c was down to 6.2 But, I also work out 3*5x week at Curves for women & watch my diet. I lost my insurance, could not afford the $248 a month for the meds. my doctor said to stay on it and gave me samples, but I stopped taking it on my own and feel much better.",5,3,3
"This drug almost did me in, or at least I felt like. It made me very dizzy, gave me shortness of breath and very sensitive to sunlight. I just felt bad overall and my glucose numbers were not all that good. I refused to take it any more after about 4 mounth. ",1,1,1
has helped very much to get a tight control on my diabetes,5,5,5
"I have been 24 hr's without the Actos and I can tell a slight difference.  I feel alittle better already.  The feet sensation is still going on but not as bad.  Mt BS tonight was 112.  So far so good.  I may have to have heart surgery because of this medication.  Anyone experiencing swelling and if you have ANY heart condition such as mine,  a heart murmur which could barely be heard and no meds for it now since the Actos may need surgery.  Be careful.  My Doc is a FNP and doesn't know I've stopped it but after stopping the Actos if things don't improve back to normal then I'll know it wasn't the Actos.",4,2,4
"I was on Avandia for a few years when the warnings came out about heart issues so I stopped taking it cold turkey (was on Glyburide and Metformin as well). Because I swore off Avandia, I was put on Januvia and Metformin, no Glyburide (which worked so well, I was in the 200 range and immediately it knocked me down 100 points) .  Well After 3 months the Januvia did not return the results like she would have hoped (is it A1c?  was at 7.9) So she switched me to Actos, Glyburide and metformin.  3 months later brings us to 3 weeks ago... my checkup brought my A1C down to 7.6 she was not happy and she always asks, do I experience swelling and I said yes my feet, calves and ANKLES especially... so tight at the end of the day they are twice the size.... she did not say anything about the Actos being the issue or possible issue.   Now we come to the last 7.6 reading.. she calls with the results and says... well we need it a bit lower so I am going to up you from 30mg to 45mg.. I hate to do this because you are already experiencing swelling.  I thought WHAT?????   She wants me to pick up some samples of the 15MG tablets and take with my 30 to see how I handle it.   I kept thinking about it.. my swelling was gone in the morning or pretty near gone but as the day went on it was not a matter of ""IF"" I would swell it was a matter of WHEN/HOW EARLY.  I work at a computer and don't get up much because I'm just too darn busy to do so... but after 8 hrs my time is mine..  I kept thinking about this and decided to cold turkey this actos... I had gained 8# which had dropped off immediately and after a couple of days my ankles were almost back to normal.. 2 weeks later my ankles are small once again (small hands and ankles are my only small anything) I wrote her she suggested other meds which sound HORRIBLE in reviews Prandin, Precos and Starlix?  I'm going to opt back to Januvia and see what happens, change diet, and cross my fingers.  Thanks EVERYONE for your feedback, INVALUABLE!!",3,1,3
"My insulin in my body is stable, but the doctor lowered my dosage from 30mg to 15mg. But so far it is worked for me, because I have changed my diet and I exercise 4-5 days a week.",4,4,4
I am taking Metformin 1000 x2 a day.  My doctor added Actos 45 for better control.  I have been taking the Actos now for a few month's maybe 3 or 4.  Since then I have lost 10 pounds not much nausea just no appetite.  The worst is now for the past month I have had leg problems feelings like if you apply Icy/Hot to a area.  My feet sweat and feel tingly tis never happened before the Actos.  I also have a heart Murmur that has got worse since the Actos.  I am stopping it myself.  I know how I feel and the feet feelings outway the control of my BS.  The foot feelings are horrible a sensation that is driving me crazy.  Walking also has been difficult because of foot cramps.  It has controled my sugars and losing 10 pounds has been a plus but this foot thing is too weird of a feeling for e.  ,4,2,3

when the actos was increased to 45 mg. I had severe swelling in both legs and feet. I also gained 45 pounds. My doctor put me on byetta and reduced the actos to 15 mg. and the swelling has completly gone and in 3 months I have lost 33 pounds. BG levels are normal most of the time.            ,5,3,3

I had rapid weight gain and I felt horrible. My doctor switched me from glipizide Metformin combo to Actos and Metformin. The Actos doesnt even seem like it helps my blood sugar levels. It just makes me fat and miserable. I took myself off of it and switched doctors!,4,1,1

"I was on Actos is the past, but my doc shanged to Januvia was on it for  about 3 mos., not effective.  He put me back on Actos 30mg about 11 days ago, so far my BS has not changed, however, the first time on Actos it controled my BS and never got over 150. Someone said it would take month to work, but don't think it did the first time, maybe some one will tell me if this is true. Now my BS runs from 140 to 250, so Actos kicks in some?",5,3,5
My husband was put on Actos in November for his diabetes. He is always tired and is always hungry and can't lose weight. He did the first month but he has gained it all back and plus a few more. He comes home from work and is more tired than usual. We do things with our children and after a few hours he has to lie down. He is active and his numbers aren't the best but better than before Actos. He eats a well balanced full meals and should not be so hungry and he HAS to eat or he gets very moody.,4,1,2
I was on actos for a year. I had shortness of breath when I took 2 or 3 steps. Within 2wks I started to gain weight. I stopped taking it on my own. I went from 150lbs to 220lbs and everytime I went to the dr I had gained. I can breath now and walk better.I am loosing since I stopped them. Be careful of that drug. My Dr. said it was asthma. But I am so much better ,1,1,1
"This medication caused sevre muscle cramps in my legs, hands and arms.  It also made me very sleepy.  This drug is very strong and your doctor should really take a indepth look at your lifestyle before putting you on it.",1,1,4
Seemed to help early on but ended up needing to increase the dosage from 15mg to 30mg to 45mg over the last year and a half.  Gained about 40lbs in that time.  Have had some dizzy spells and heart palpitations as well I feel the Actos was partly to blame for all of those symptoms and in the end was not very effective at helping me manage my blood sugar.  Was also taking 1000mg Metformin twice a day.  My Dr. had switched me to Januvia and Glyburide in place of the Actos and will continue the Metformin.  We shall see how this goes.,5,2,2
MY BLOOD SUGAR STILL IS VERY HIGH WITH ACTOS,3,1,2
When I started Actos my blood sugars were around 150-160 on other meds. When I added Actos my sugar readings  are now in the mid 90's in the AM check.  WOW! Am I satisfied. I did however have some gum irritation and sinusitis which I took care of with anantibiotic.,5,4,5
After 3 months on this med I suffered a stress fracture in my left foot. I have NEVER broken a bone prior to this and have walked daily for over 20 years! There was absolutely nothing I did differently to cause a foot fracture. Then I learned of the press release warning about increases in hand and foot fractures in women. I cannot begin to tell you the discomfort of having to be in a cast and on crutches for 7 weeks and now physical therapy to relearn how to walk!  THIS MEDICATION SHOULD BE RECALLED!!!!! ,4,1,1

Started by taking 15 mg/day + 2000 mg/day of Metformin.  That didn't work at all.  Increased Actos to 30 mg/day after 60 days.  Still didn't work.  I'm now up to 45 mg/day and finally getting some results.  I really want this to work.,3,3,4

After taking this drug for a 2 days I began having serious headaches. On day 6 the headaches left me bedridden and my eyes began to blur. My Dr. took me off this drug as well as my metformin. Since then my headaches have decreased dramatically but my vision still blurs at times. ,4,1,1
My left leg swelled to the point of severe pain.  I gained 30 pounds in 5 months and kept getting shorter and shorter of breath.  I changed Doctors and was taken off the Actos and my metformin increased from 500 MG twice daily to 850 mg.  The first night I took the 850 mg of metformin only the swelling had decreased by 75 percent.  I have been on the metformin only for four days and already the shortness of breath has decreased.  The swelling is almost completely gone.,5,1,1
I've been taking Actos for almost a year now and my glucose levels have reduced significantly.  The only weight gain that I have experienced brought me back to my pre-diabetes weight.,5,4,4

Neither of these drugs was effective in lowering my blood sugar, so I stopped taking them six months ago. Since then I have been sleeping well throughout the night for 7 or 8 hours usually without any recollection of dreaming and no nightmares. Last night I took my first dose of Actos and suffered the same terrifying and very vivid nightmares about drowning. I awoke half a dozen times huffing and puffing, all out of breath and was unable to sleep past 3 am.  I've had enough. ",5,1,1

I was on 15mg a day actos for the past 14 months during that time i gained 55 lbs and could not lose them no matter what i tried. In the past 4 months i have experienced shortness of breath and chest discomfort while walking. My dr took me off actos 2 weeks ago and put me on novolog. I just took a chemical stress test and got abnormal results back today. I think those results are from the medication actos but that remains to be seen.,4,1,2

"I have a moderate to severe case of PolyCystic Ovarian Syndrome.  The recommended drug of choice to treat that disorer (Glucophage/Metformin) had so many dangerous side effects for me that I couldn't take a full dose of it.  In the end, the doctor found it wasn't even helping lower my insulin levels and my cholesterol and triglycerides were high.    My endocrinologist took a more creative approach and tried this medication.  After three months, she had my labs rechecked and I was sure it wasn't working because I had no side effects.  Labs showed my cholesterol had dropped 20 points, triglycerides had come down significantly and my insulin levels had been cut in half.  My last round of labs in September showed my insulin level was 5.1 and cholesterol was 166.    This past May I dove into a healthy weight loss plan and managed to drop over 25 lbs.  (Lowered my calorie intake, added more fruits and veggies, started exercising an hour a day.) While I've got a lot more weight to lose, I've been able to maintain the weightloss pretty easily.    Since I've lost the weight, I've found my energy level has increased significantly.  The only side effect I have is very mild water retention (probably a couple of pounds max).    While their are significant side effects for some people, there are people (like me)out there who are glad this drug is on the market.  I couldn't ask for better results.  ",5,5,5

"I have been taking Actos for 10 months until Oct. 2008. My feet and ankles were so swollen I couldn't wear shoes or sandals, I hurt so bad. The end of Sept. I began having trouble breathing. Within 2 weeks I was gasping for air just sitting in a chair. I ended up in the hospital for a week the beginning of Oct. After numerous tests for CHF I was diagnosed with Paricardial Effussion (fluid in the sack surrounding my heart) inhibiting the hearts ability to function which could have killed me if I hadn't finally by passed my Dr. and went to the E.R. If you are on Actos, do your research. Keep after your Dr. if you experience swelling, shortness of breath, painful muscles and joints, and weight gain. I gained 43 lbs. in 10 months. I discontinued Actos on Oct. 5 and have lost 17 lbs. by doing nothing different except stopping the Actos. I had a repeat Echocardiogram a few days ago and the fluid around my heart is gone.

"After being diagnosed as a Type 2 Diabetic, I thought removing most carbs and sugar from my diet would help me lose some weight, but much to my surprise, I started gaining pounds (almost 50 extra pounds in 4 years).  My ankles were constantly swollen and the muscles in my leg never stopped aching and cramping; I could hardly walk.  My doctor had a different diagnosis for every one of my complaints, from being told I had developed osteoarthritis to obesity (I weighed 153 lbs. at the time).  He NEVER told me that weight gain, swollen ankles and sore leg muscles were all side effects of Actos, the prescription he had me taking for the last four years to treat my diabetes.  When I started having severe chest pains and difficulty breathing, the cardiologist told me to discuss changing meds with my doctor.  I'm now on Glucophage and I'm losing weight and feeling GREAT, and no more chest pains or swollen ankles :-)  Before taking Actos, carefully study the side effects, and if you develop any of them, make sure you tell your doctor that you'd like something other than Actos.

"ever since I was prescribed this medicine since 05/2008, I was rushed to the hospital once with arytmia, I was diagnosed a hesrt condition and I have gained 25 pounds, how can the FDA allow this medicine to go on the market and still continue to be sold if the consequences of using it are far worse than the sickness it is supposed to treat (diabetes). I am not taking it any more by my doctors advice.",1,1,1

my glucose has gone down i am happy,4,4,4
the medication has caused me to gain 16 lbs in 8 days.  I can't wear shoes or use my hands very well because of the water retention,5,1,4
I have begun feeling so physically tire and exhausted from lack of energy that I no longer get much exercise at all. Our family physician insists the benefits outweigh the side effects. Are there any options? ,5,1,3
"a little fluid retention, but otherwise few side effects.  Cost is almost prohibitive, tho",5,5,5
"I was able to tolerate only 5 days on this drug.  Severe joint & abdominal pain, swelling and bloated.  A poor replacement for glucophage and metformin (which gave me debilitating diahrrea and kept me in a stupor).  None of them were successful in lowering my blood sugar readings.  Am now on Januvia and am WELL pleased and my readings are now consistently within normal ranges.",5,1,1
"After several years my glucose numbeers dropped, but, when they would be in the 80s or 90s I would feel dizzy and unsteady.  I have to get my numberes inthe 100s. I,also,take metformin and glyburide and aggronox.",4,3,3
"My blood sugars tend to be higher with this drug than without it, I have trouble sleeping at night when I'm on this drug even though I take it in the AM, my fluid pill is not as effective while on this medicine - BUT the alternative is insulin?  So I take it and don't complain. ",4,2,2
Started Actos when fisrt diagnosed with diabetes in combination with metformin as  once in the morning. Added metformin and glyburide at night. Noticed about 10-15 kilo weight gain over one year period. Also undertreamnent for high BP and high cholestrol ,4,3,4
seems to work ok,3,3,3
"I have been on Actos (30mg) for a little over two weeks and my levels have been reduced by 30 points. Still in bad range, but I read that typically it could take several weeks to be effective. I did not tolerate Metformin well at all. Minimal side-effects.",5,3,2

Have had 7 broken bones also. My reads are better but, this weight gain is going to kill me, if high readings don't, I am at 315.  Is there nothing to take that helps. ",2,2,3
"Experienced severe leg cramps at night, swelling in feet and ankles, and weight loss at 45 mg. per day. Cramps and swelling stopped almost immediately when i stopped the medication. Blood sugra stabilized when I take this occassionally. My dr. will switch me to 15 mg. This medication did help greatly, but the side effects were unacceptable.",4,3,4
Actos has made me retain water in ankles and feet and tightness of skin in legs and arms. I have also gained weight while taking it. I am weaning myself off of it. I do need to lose weight and the Actos is making it impossible.,3,2,3

"I have not had a good experience with this treatment and finally got off of it due to weight gain and swealing, I was put on Metformin than made me sick at my stomach, then Januvia and it has worked with no side effects to date.  I was asked did I care if I gained weight or did I mind a yuck stomach WELL great let me see where to I sign up for this great deal...THEY WILL TRY TO SELL YOU ON THE OLDER AND CHEAPER DRUG BEFORE THE UNVAIL JANUVIA.  I hope you don't have to stay green on the old stand by.

My insurance co-pay is almost $30.00 now. I am considering having to stop taking this med which has been very helpful. I have stopped taking it for a week now to see if I can survive safely without it. I just cannot afford that much money for 1 drug. Why can't a generic be made for it so it can be more affordable to those of us who need it?,4,4,4

"I have been on Actos for just over a month now for my Type 2 Diabetes (Diagnosed Dec. 2006) due to a reation to Metformin.  My Blood Glucose Levels are now where they should be with the Actos and I feel much better.  However, I just found out that I am a bit anemic, a common side effect of Actos.  However, I remain on a strict diet, try to exercise (walk) 30min each day,reduce/eliminate Salt from my diet and take B12 daily. I hope to be able to continue the Actos as I reduce my weight and hopefully my need for any medications at all for my Type 2 Diabetes. ",4,3,4
"I have been on Actos for about a month.  I've lost about six pounds but I don't have much energy and I feel as though I am experiencing morning sickness all day, especially in the evening. And I'm way too old to be pregnant. I also have many bouts of loose stools that leaves an embarassing trail if I sneeze or cough hard.  I never had anything like that before I started Actos.  My glucose levels are finally in the acceptable range after several years. Of course, being nauseated keeps me from any sweet cravings, too. Overall, I don't feel as well as I used to even when my blood sugar level was in the 200 plus range. And I found out the hard way that alcohol is definitely a no-no.  Eyes swelled up for days after one drink.",5,3,4
You will gain wieght using this drug.  I also have found that I can no longer eat certian foods.  I don't know if it's the drug interaction with those foods or what.  I also am experiencing what I like to call Butt Drip...  An itching sensation that usually calls for me to wipe what I thought was previously clean only to find a smear on the paper.,4,4,4
After my second dose  (15mg) I started with episodes of muscle spasticity and cramping in (L) adductors and (r) quadriceps;  I stopped Lipitor 3 years ago for this same symptom ,5,1,1
water retention in the legs,4,2,4
"I have had no problems with this medication.  In fact, I have had less side effects than I did with Avandia, which I used before.  ",5,5,5
"Actos always caused fluid retention in my legs.  After little over a year on it, i asked doctor if we could try metformin ER as regular metformin had caused stomach and loose bowels.  The metformin worked without problems, but the swelling did not leave my left leg.  After several weeks of checkups and doctor visits, i was told to go to radiology at the hospital.  There it was discovered i had DVT and was immediately admitted for treatment.  Placed on Heparin and then on coumadin i was sent home after 5 days.  Still have swelling in left leg.  Never did have any pain from this condition.  I wonder if actos contributed to blood clot forming as we cannot determine the cause for this as i'm very active and had no history of this problem.",4,1,3
"I used this for about 5 weeks, I gained 11 pounds in that time and I have extreme swollen ankles and feet.  I stopped taking this 5 days ago.",4,1,3

I WONDER IF IT IS WORTH $210.00 a month,5,2,2
"After taking Actos for 8 months, I suddenly had very bad anemia and low ferritin levels in the tissues. After taking iron and undergoing lots of tests, I noticed an article in the newspaper that said anemia was a possible side effect. I stopped taking it and my iron was fine in a couple months. I am able to donate blood again.",5,1,3
Loved it,4,5,5
Works well with insulin combo therapy.I wish a generic version was avaliable.,3,3,5
It has kept my type 2 diabetes under controlS,4,4,4
"I can't answer any of the rating questions since I have just started taking Actos 15 mg.  I was concerned about the cardiac risk with Avandia which I was taking before so my doc switched me to Actos.  I am also taking metformin and was taking a sulfonylurea which he also stopped.  This was puzzling to me but I will see what happens.  So far my blood sugars seem ok but it has only been a day or so.  I am closely monitoring.  My A1C was 6.1 on the 3med (metformin, avandia, glyburide) regimen so we shall see what happens with this 2 med regimen.",4,3,4

"I have been taking this medication for about a year and have experience swollen ankles, stiff fingers, tooth problems I didn't have before, weight gain of over 50 lbs that I can lose no matter how hard I try, muscle aches and breathing problems.  My doctor put me on this medication because my sugar levels jumped to 200 after meals.  I also take glipizide. I'm going to stop taking Actos for a couple of months and see if my problems disappear.  If they do, then I'll stop taking the medicine completely.  I'm tired of the mucles aches that cause me to be too tired to do any of the activities I enjoy doing.   ",5,2,4

I take 15mg of Actos once daily in the pm for several years and rarely is my level below 105 and often it can be up to 118 in the am after 12 hours of fast.I haven't had any side affects But I do wish it would less in the am. Yet if I eat about a 1/4 lb of cooked pasta about 5pm I can have a reading of 120 in just 2 hours .Confusing to me.    ,5,3,4
"This medicine lowered my blood sugars to extremely low levels. It gave me upper repiratory, sinusitus and an extremely painful sore throat. At first I thought I was experiencing the flu from the muscle and joint aches. It then went to a coughin lung like infection. Next came a sinus infection that was bloody. Lastly a sore throat made me look up the adverse affects of this med. I stopped taking it this morning and am able to speak today. The sore throat is clearing and pain going away.",5,1,4

"I'm on Actos 15mg 3 times a day along with 850mg of Metformin.  I'm a marathon runner so I'm quite active.  However, Actos surely made me gain weight and my thighs just gotten bigger and for awhile I didn't know why.  I run about 25-30 miles per week and when the training got intensed, I run 20-22 miles just on Saturdays.  My hands and feet get swolen and I had problems breathing.  Gonna take myself off Actos for now.  I'm training for another marathon in June and cannot risk being heavy with breathing problems.",3,1,4
"I asked my Doc to talk me off Avandia because of FDA warnings; started Actos a few weeks ago. I have defintely gained weight already and started having diffuse pain in my thighs. So I called an on-call Doc and he said to stop it and talk to my regular doctor. I did, and after a week, my pants started falling off me...seriously...and the thigh pain went away (it had been feeling like I had been doing heavy weights/leg extensions in the gym). So, then my regular doc finally go ahold of me and said to start it this weekend again, and if I started having problems, he'd switch me back to Avandia. Well, in just 2 days I can already feel a little pain in my thighs and I feel like my pep is being zapped. I'll call him tomorrow and switch back and take my chances with Avandia, which I had no problems with in the first place.",5,1,2
I am concerned about my being tired most of the time like no energy.  Is that something I have to talk to my doctor about?

Right now I am still taking Actos with Januvia and Prandin for my maintenance medication. Please advise. Thanks,4,3,3
"I experienced swelling of ankles and hands  for quite a time, then found it was due partly to the high dosage recommended by my doctor. When the dosage was cut in half,  this improved markedly, and had very little effect on later glucose readings. Suggestion: check with your doctor, see if a reduced dosage helps .",4,1,3
"I was spiking to 250 when the Doc put me on Actos, right away I got migraines and my nose bleed. I won't take it anymore.",4,1,1

worked well for 2 months then a steady decline in effetivness,5,2,2
I only have one negative thing to say about this medication and it is a warning to pregnant women.  Even if you doctor says it is safe DO NOT TAKE IT during pregnancy.  My son has serious health conditions now linked to this medication that I was taking while pregnant.,4,3,4
Super control of blood sugar levels with this drug.,5,5,5
Before taking this medication my blood glucose was high in the mornings anywhere from 160 to 230 ---now i'm getting readings of eighties and nineties in the mornings----I am so pleased.,4,4,4

This medication made my feel swell terribly.,5,1,1
"The one side effect that I hate is that over the years (almost immediately, and continuingly) I gained 50 lbs.--wasn't eating even 1/3 of what I used to eat.  When it says in the side effects ""may cause weight gain""  it REALLY DOES, and I haven't been able to lose that weight.",4,3,4

"In about 6 months with Actos I have gained 15 pounds. I had been able to control my glucose level for nearly 6 years with diet and exercise before my levels increased. Actos gives me a range of readings from 94 to 140. I am eating less and exercising more than ever to NO avail. Additionally, I have had about a dozen days of low blood sugar.  I would gladly go to something else if there is something better. I have given Actos a fair trial and am very disappointed. Does the maker NOT understand Type 2 diabetes at ALL? Weight gain as a side effect is ludicrous!   Dr. Walter Yingling",5,2,3
"Overall this med has worked for me however; I have gained over 50 lbs in a two year period. My doctor has now prescribed byetta, which I now have been on it for 3 months.",5,3,4

I don't run to the bathroom anymore and don't feel like my heart is racing anymore, as i did with Metaformin (it was a reation). I also take glyburide with this and this combonation is working for me. Note, I don't drink and or smoke. I try to get as much exercise as possible by walking and by bicycle.
